# Part 6: Application

# This script explains how to create and deploy Applications in CML.
# This feature allows data scientists to **get ML solutions in front of stakeholders quickly**,
# including business users who need results fast.
# This may be good for sharing a **highly customized dashboard**, a **monitoring tool**, or a **product mockup**.

# CML is agnostic regarding frameworks.
# [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/),
# [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/),
# or even [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) apps will all work.
# R users will find it easy to deploy Shiny apps.

# If you haven't yet, run through the initialization steps in the README file. Do that
# now

# This file is provides a sample Flask app script, ready for deployment,
# which displays churn predictions and explanations using the Model API deployed in
# Part 5

# Deploying the Application
#
# > Once you have written an app that is working as desired, including in a test Session,
# > it can be deployed using the *New Application* dialog in the *Applications* tab in CML.

# After accepting the dialog, CML will deploy the application then *assign a URL* to
# the Application using the subdomain you chose.
#
# *Note:* This does not require the `cdsw-build.sh* file as it does not follow a
# seperate build process to deploy an application.
#

# To create an Application using our sample Flask app, perform the following.
# This is a special step for this particular app:
#
# In the deployed Model from step 5, go to *Model* > *Settings* in CML and make a note of (i.e. copy) the
# "**Access Key**". eg - `mqc8ypo...pmj056y`
#
# While you're there, **disable** the additional Model authentication feature by unticking **Enable Authentication**.
#
# **Note**: Disabling authentication is only necessary for this Application to work.
# Ordinarily, you may want to keep Authentication in place.
#
# Next, from the Project level, click on *Open Workbench* (note you don't actually have to Launch a
# Session) in order to edit a file. Select the `flask/single_view.html` file and paste the Access
# Key in at line 19.
#
# `        const accessKey = "mp3ebluylxh4yn5h9xurh1r0430y76ca";`
#
# Save the file (if it has not auto saved already) and go back to the Project.
#
# Finally, go to the *Applications* section of the Project and select *New Application* with the following:
# * **Name**: Churn Analysis App
# * **Subdomain**: churn-app _(note: this needs to be unique, so if you've done this before,
# pick a more random subdomain name)_
# * **Script**: 6_application.py
# * **Kernel**: Python 3
# * **Engine Profile**: 1 vCPU / 2 GiB Memory
#
# Accept the inputs, and in a few minutes the Application will be ready to use.

# Using the Application

# >  A few minutes after deploying, the *Applications* page will show the app as Running.
# You can then click on its name to access it.
# CML Applications are accessible by any user with read-only (or higher) access to the project.
#

# This deploys a basic flask application for serving the HTML and some specific data
# use for project Application.

# At this point, you will be able to open the Churn Analysis App.
# The initial view is a table of randomly selected customers from the dataset.
# This provides a snapshot of the customer base as a whole.
# The colors in the *Probability* column correspond to the prediction, with red customers being deemed more likely to churn.
# The colors of the features show which are most important for each prediction.
# Deeper red indicates incresed importance for predicting that a customer **will churn**
# while deeper blue indicates incresed importance for predicting that a customer **will not**.

#
# Changing the *InternetService* to *DSL* lowers the probablity of churn.
# **Note**: this obviously does *not* mean that you should change that customer's internet service to DSL
# and expect they will be less likely to churn.
# Imagine if your ISP did that to you.
# Rather, the model is more optimistic about an otherwise identical customer who has been using DSL.
# This information simply gives you a clearer view of what to expect given specific factors
# as a starting point for developing your business strategies.
# Furthermore, as you start implementing changes based on the model, it may change customers' behavior
# so that the predictions stop being reliable.
# It's important to use Jobs to keep models up-to-date.
