## Part 7a - Model Operations - Drift Simulation
#
# This script show cases how to use the model operations features of CML.
# # This feature allows machine learning engineering to **measure and manage models 
# through their life cycle**, and know how a model is performing over time. As part
# of the larger machine learning lifecycle, this closes the loop on managing
# models that have been deployed into production.

### Add Model Metrics
# New  metrics can be added to a model and existing ones updated using the `cdsw` 
# library and the [model metrics SDK](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/model-metrics/topics/ml-tracking-model-metrics-using-python.html)
# If model metrics is enabled for a model, then every call to that model is recorded
# in the model metric database. There are situations in which its necessary to update or
# add to those recordered metrics. This script shows you how this works.

#### Update Exsiting Tracked Metrics
# This is part of what is called "ground truth". Certain machine learning implemetations, 
# (like this very project) will use a supervised approach where a model is making a 
# prediction and the acutal value (or lable) is only available at later stage. To check
# how well a model is performing, these actual values need to be compared with the 
# prediction the model. Each time a model end point is called, it provides the response
# from the function, some other details and a unique uuid for that response.
# This tracked model response entry can then be updated at a later date to add the 
# actual "ground truth" value, or any other data that you want to add.
#
# Data can be added to a tracked model response using the `cdsw.track_delayed_metrics`. 
#
# ```python
# help(cdsw.track_delayed_metrics)
# Help on function track_delayed_metrics in module cdsw:
#
# track_delayed_metrics(metrics, prediction_uuid)
#    Description
#    -----------
#    
#    Track a metric for a model prediction that is only known after prediction time.
#    For example, for a model that makes a binary or categorical prediction, the actual
#    correctness of the prediction is not known at prediction time. This function can be
#    used to retroactively to track a prediction's correctness later, when ground truth
#    is available
#        Example:
#            >>>track_delayed_metrics({"ground_truth": "value"}, "prediction_uuid")
#    
#    Parameters
#    ----------
#    metrics: object
#        metrics object
#    prediction_uuid: string, UUID
#        prediction UUID of model metrics
# ```

#### Adding Additional Metrics
# It is also possible to add additional data/metrics to the model database to track
# things like aggrerate metrics that aren't associated with the one particular response.
# This can be done using the `cdsw.track_aggregate_metrics` function.

# ```python
# help(cdsw.track_aggregate_metrics)
# Help on function track_aggregate_metrics in module cdsw:
# 
# track_aggregate_metrics(metrics, start_timestamp_ms, end_timestamp_ms, model_deployment_crn=None)
#    Description
#    -----------
#    
#    Track aggregate metric data for model deployment or model build or model
#        Example:
#            >>>track_aggregate_metrics({"val_count": 125}, 1585685142786,
#            ... 1585685153602, model_deployment_crn="/db401b6a-4b26-4c8f-8ea6-a1b09b93db88"))
#    
#    Parameters
#    ----------
#    metrics: object
#        metrics data object
#    start_timestamp_ms: int
#        aggregated metrics start timestamp in milliseconds
#    end_timestamp_ms: int
#        aggregated metrics end timestamp in milliseconds
#    model_deployment_crn: string
#       model deployment Crn
# ```
# 

### Model Drift Simlation
# This script simulates making calls to the model using sample data, and slowly
# introducting an increasing amount of random variation to the churn value so that
# the model will be less accurate over time. 

# The script will grab 1000 random samples from the data set and simulate 1000 
# predictions. The live model will be called each time in the loop and while the 
# `churn_error` function adds an increasing amount of error to the data to make 
# the model less accurate. The actual value, the response value and the uuid are 
# added to an array.
# 
# Then there is "ground truth" loop that iterates though the array and updates the
# recorded metric to add the actual lable value using the uuid. At the same time, the
# model accruacy is evaluated every 100 samples and added as an aggregate metric.
# Overtime this accuracy metric falls due the error introduced into the data.
